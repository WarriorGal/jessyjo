			<ul>
				<li><b>Calendars are essential.</b> Organization is key. Dedicate time to get important things done to reduce or eliminate procrastination.</li>
				<li><b>Be good to yourself.</b> Eat and sleep everyday. Take time off when needed. See a doctor regularly. Understand that you are your own toughest critic.</li>
				<li><b>New things aren’t scary.</b> Even if you end up hating the new thing you just tried, you now know that this is something to steer clear of in the future.</li>
				<li><b>You can do anything.</b> Get started anywhere and you will end up somewhere.</li>
				<li><b>Spend time doing things you like.</b> Be around people who love you often. Have separate hobbies from your career.</li>
				<li><b>Don’t obsess.</b> Take a deep breath when you are feeling overwhelmed. Take breaks. Ask for second opinions.</li>
				<li><b>Figure things out along the way.</b> Don’t let not knowing how to do something stop you from doing it. 
				<li><b>Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.</b> Your first attempt looks like crap. Do it again.</li>
				<li><b>Kindness goes a long way.</b> People are willing to do more things for you if you are nice.</li>
				<li><b>Change is okay.</b> If you have had an idea for a long time that all of a sudden you feel differently about, embrace it. Change is personal growth.</li>
